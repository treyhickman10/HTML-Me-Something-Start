			<h1>Most Impactful Music Albums</h1>
			<p>
				I believe that music is the most universally enjoyed form of art that
				exists for humans. Everyone has a song or genre that speaks to them and
				evokes an emotional response. These are not all albums that I would say
				are some of my favorite albums or ones that I listen to much anymore but
				are ones that impacted me and made me see or think about the world and
				music a little differently. Music is something that I grew up around as
				it seemed my father couldn't stand silence and always had something
				playing from his large CD collection whenever we were hanging around the
				house. These are in a loose chronological order.

				<h2><em>Man On The Moon II: The Legend Of Mr.Rager</em> by Kid Cudi</h2>
				<p>
					<em>Man On The Moon II</em> is an album that was one of the first
					albums that felt personal to me. Even the name of the album being what
					it is matched how I felt about myself at the time. Although I had many
					friends from playing baseball and going to school with, I still never
					felt like anyone ever truly understood me or knew exactly who I was.
					The song “All Along” seemed to be one that struck me in a way that not
					many other songs had before. Its thoughtful lyrics and slow, simple
					melody would be a combination that would stick with me as many of my
					favorite songs since then follow the same blueprint.

				<h2><em>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</em> by Mac Miller</h2>
				<p>
					<em>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</em> was an album that was less
					personal and more an album that changed my way of seeing music. I was
					never into the music that you would usually hear playing at high
					school parties but this album solidified that music was not about the
					excitement or flash that you felt while listening. The album came
					after Macadelic which was Mac Miller's big departure from the type of
					music I am referring to so it was close to being the album on the list
					but this one was the one that really stood out as the one that set me
					on a different path in my musical interests. Even though I don't
					listen to as much hip-hop music, I can still listen and appreciate
					this album for its seriousness and its truths about life.

				<h2><em>The Basement Tapes</em> by Bob Dylan and The Band</h2>
				<p>
					<em>The Basement Tapes</em> is an album that has very little
					significance for the actual music in the album but more about the
					connection that it has to people in my life. It was an album that was
					gifted to me and the rest of my family by my late older brother Kyle.
					There was an 11 year gap between him and I. He was a fan of Bob Dylan
					and used to sing and play guitar to Bob Dylan songs when I was very
					young and he was almost out of the house. The song that stands out is
					the song “Goin' to Acapulco” which was shared shortly after his
					passing by some of his friends as a good song to capture his true
					spirit. Life is not worth worrying about and you should just be
					looking to have fun and experience the exciting side of life. For
					better or worse, I believe they are correct.

				<h2><em>Fear Fun</em> by Father John Misty</h2>
				<p>
					<em>Fear Fun</em> is an album that transformed my musical tastes like
					no other album. I found it after searching Father John Misty after
					hearing his powerfully dynamic voice sampled on a track by Kid Cudi
					who at the time was one of my favorite artists. <em>Fear Fun</em> was
					unlike anything I had been listening to before that but I instantly
					became a huge fan of the album and Father John Misty. It opened my
					eyes to new genres of music that I had never known existed. His
					philosophical lyrics fit into exactly what my mind was curious about
					personally. The timing of my initiation to this type of music could
					not have been better timed.

				<h2><em>Middle Brother</em> by Middle Brother</h2>
				<p>
					<em>Middle Brother</em> is the only single album from a folk rock
					supergroup of John McCauley of Deer Tick, Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes,
					and Matt Vasquez of Delta Spirit. Before finding this album I was a
					fan of Deer Tick and Dawes but had heard very little of Delta Spirit.
					I still listen to both Dawes and Deer Tick while I still don't know
					much about Delta Spirit. This album hit me when I was just beginning
					to figure life out on my own. I had made some bad decisions that had a
					large impact on the trajectory of my life in good and bad ways. This
					album holds songs, both originals and covers, about heartbreak,
					delusion, resilience, and deep truths. When asked what kind of music I
					listen to I will always reference this album as an example of what
					leaves the deepest impact on me. I love every song on this one.

				<h2><em>Sound & Color</em> by Alabama Shakes</h2>
				<p>
					<em>Sound & Color</em> is an album that brought out a different side
					of me at a time in my life when I was starting to feel the isolation
					of worrying about what people thought about me. The Alabama Shakes
					were the headliner for one night of the Buzz Beach Ball festival in
					Kansas City. It had been a long day in the sun and the sun was going
					down as they started their show. Although it may have been a drug
					fueled feeling, I was not worried at all about what was going on
					around me. They put on a great show and I danced all the way through
					it. I think I had a mental breakthrough when instead of feeling like
					people were staring at us because we were weird or strange but because
					they felt like they would have a better time joining in. Something
					about this moment really brought me out of a mental health decline
					that I was dealing with at the time.

				<h2><em>The Muse</em> by The Wood Brothers</h2>
				<p>
					<em>The Muse</em> is an album that my wife and I share a love for. It
					was an album that we listened to a lot while working together and when
					we first started dating. It is also my favorite album from one one of
					my favorite artists. They also have put on a great show the two times
					I have gone to their shows. Their performances and music blend so many
					styles and influences and all of it seems truly original and creative.
					My favorite moment of their shows is when they bring out a single
					old-timey microphone and they all get around it and play into the
					single microphone. It creates a sound that is incomparable to modern
					microphone techniques. This choice is purely for my love and respect
					for what they do.

				<h2><em>Metamodern Sounds in Country Music</em> by Sturgill Simpson</h2>
				<p>
					Metamodern Sounds in Country Music changed my opinion on the genre of
					country music. This was not the typical country album that sang about
					trucks, beer, and girls. It had real thoughtful lyrics and killer
					melodies. Even the opening track's name is a mention of a
					philosophical thought experiment and the track talks about different
					ways of seeing the world and living a better life. It felt like the
					first time that I had heard country songs that sang about things that
					I actually thought were worth entering the realm of art and
					creativity. This marks another opening up of my musical interests and
					a realization that genre is not a helpful way to categorize music and
					its similarities.
